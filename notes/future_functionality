future functionality:

1) functions to compute the CF2 Kendrick mass defect (KMD) and cluster masses with similar KMDs

2) functions to graphically represent the clustering results

3) functions to compare detected masses to known compounds in the Norman Network PFC list

4) functions to clean up the Norman Network PFC list (e.g., to remove duplicates and salts and to segregate ionic compounds)
